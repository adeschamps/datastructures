# Data Structures #
A collection of data structures in the spirit of the C++ Standard Library

## splaytree ##
See en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_Tree

Splay trees move a node to the root every time it is accessed.
This makes recently accessed nodes much faster to find.
For many practical applications, they can be faster than other trees.
